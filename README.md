For this challenge I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past challenge. Specifically, we'll be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. A landing page is provided where we can see a comparison of all of the plots and the data itself.
